This repository is for learning the basics of the Python programming language. 
The folders are meant to be explored in order, with each session building 
to a greater or lesser extent on the previous ones. Single line comments start with #, while multiline comments begin and end with """. I aim to have a largely unverbose tutorial to encourage reading and understanding the code itself.
